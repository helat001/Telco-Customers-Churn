##  Project Overview

This project explores customer churn using a Telco dataset. I built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using Python, focusing on preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, XGBoost modeling, and SHAP explainability.

##  Key Insights

###  Churn Distribution
The churn dataset is imbalanced with ~27% churners.

---

###  Tenure vs. Churn
Customers with low tenure (under 12 months) are more likely to churn.

---

###  Correlation Matrix
Tenure is highly correlated with TotalCharges. Churn is positively correlated with MonthlyCharges and negatively with Tenure.

###  Feature Importance (XGBoost)
Top predictors: MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges, Tenure, Contract type.

---

###  SHAP Summary Plot
High churn risk comes from short tenure, month-to-month contract, and high charges.

##  Business Recommendations (Short & Actionable)

-  Encourage long-term contracts to reduce churn
-  Improve onboarding for new customers (< 90 days)
-  Offer bundles or discounts for high-paying customers
-  Promote add-ons like online security & tech support
-  Push for automatic payments over manual e-checks
-  Use the model to identify and retain high-risk customers
-  Support seniors & single customers with tailored service
-  Continuously retrain the model and track strategy outcomes
